# Smart Farm Backend - Crop Recommendation Model

This project serves as the backend for the Smart Farm project. It uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict the most suitable crops for farmers to plant. Additionally, it also predicts the optimal time for planting these crops.

## Project Overview

The Smart Farm project aims to revolutionize farming by providing data-driven insights to farmers. By leveraging AI, we can make accurate predictions about the best crops to plant and the ideal time to plant them. This not only increases crop yield but also enhances the efficiency of farming operations.

## Features

- Crop Recommendation: Suggests the best crops to plant based on various factors such as soil type, climate, and more.
- Planting Time Prediction: Predicts the best time to plant the recommended crops to ensure the highest yield.
